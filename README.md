# Instructions  
Write a program that takes two input numbers, then adds them together and prints the result.

**Remember** This project will be automatically graded, and computers are very literal!

## Extra time

If you complete this task then please try adding the following features:
* Take two numbers and subtract the second from the first number.
* Take two numbers and multiply the two.
* Take two numbers and divide the first number by the second number.
* Take two numbers and perform a modulus operation.
* Allow users to choose which operation they want to perform on two numbers.
* Take 3 numbers and add them together.
* Allow users to mix operations with 3 numbers or more
e.g. 2 + 4 - 3, 4 *5 + 1 / 3

**Note:** These features must be presented to the user *after* the initial task, or else the automatic grading will mark this as failed! Scoring for additional features will be done manually.
